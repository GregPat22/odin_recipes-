          <p class="forThe">For the Dough:</p>
          <li>Gather ingredients</li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10
            minutes until it becomes frothy.
          </li>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt.</li>
          <li>
            Make a well in the center and pour the yeast mixture into the well.
          </li>
          <li>Gradually mix the flour into the liquid until a dough forms.</li>
          <li>
            Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10-15 minutes until
            smooth and elastic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth,
            and let it rise for about 1-1.5 hours or until doubled in size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to its highest setting (usually around 475-500°F or
            245-260°C).
          </li>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="forThe">For the Tomato sauce:</p>
          <li>
            Gather the ingredients for the tomato sauce: canned tomatoes,
            garlic, olive oil, salt, and fresh basil (optional).
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat a bit of olive oil in a pan and sauté minced garlic until
            fragrant
          </li>
          <li>Add the canned tomatoes and crush them with a fork or spoon.</li>
          <li>
            Simmer the sauce on low heat for about 20-30 minutes, stirring
            occasionally.
          </li>
          <li>
            Season with salt and add fresh basil leaves if desired. Remove from

        <div>
          <p class="forThe">Assembling and Baking the Pizza:</p>
          <li>
            Once the dough has risen, divide it into two portions for two
            pizzas.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness
            and shape.
          </li>
          <li>Transfer the rolled dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
          <li>
            Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small
            border at the edges.
          </li>
          <li>Add fresh mozzarella cheese evenly on top of the sauce.</li>
          <li>Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza.</li>
          <li>Place a few fresh basil leaves on top.</li>
          <li>
            Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes or
            until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and slightly
            bubbly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
